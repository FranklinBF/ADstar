DESCRIPTION
===========


After many failed searches for a publicly available neat implementation of the anytime D* algorithm (except the SBPL version which is very modular and rigid), I decided to write my own implementation. It is not yet fully completed and tested. Currently ongoing.


Note that the implementation is written for planning on a 3-dimensional grid world. You can use it for 2-dimensional planning by restricting the Z-dimension to have a size of 1 (duh)
